## Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Agents are equipped with a three-level hierarchical reinforcement learning framework:
- **High-Level Goals:** Agents select high-level goals such as Economic Growth, Cultural Dominance, and Military Expansion.
- **Mid-Level Strategies:** Based on the selected high-level goals, agents choose appropriate strategies such as Resource Accumulation, Propaganda Spread, or Diplomatic Influence.
- **Low-Level Actions:** Finally, the agents execute specific actions that align with their strategies, leveraging PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to optimize their decisions.

### 2. Cognitive Architecture
Each agent is built upon a sophisticated cognitive architecture that includes:
- **Neural Perception:** Agents process environmental data through neural networks to generate perceptions of the state.
- **Symbolic Reasoning:** Agents apply symbolic reasoning to infer actions from perceptions, integrating classical AI techniques.
- **Emotion and Personality Modeling:** Agents have individual personality traits and emotional states that influence their decisions and interactions with others.
- **Memory Systems:** Agents maintain working memory, long-term memory, episodic memory, and procedural memory, allowing them to learn from past experiences and adjust their strategies dynamically.

### 3. Meta-Learning
Agents can improve their learning capabilities over time through meta-learning:
- **Experience Replay:** Agents can revisit past experiences to refine their decision-making models.
- **Task Adaptation:** Agents can adapt to new tasks more quickly by leveraging learned meta-models.
- **Cognitive and Behavioral Flexibility:** The cognitive architecture supports adjustments in strategies based on changing environmental conditions or internal states.

### 4. Social and Cultural Dynamics
- **Cultural Evolution:** Agents' cultural practices evolve over time, influenced by immigration, technological advancements, and wars.
- **Social Networks:** Agents maintain dynamic social networks, where connections between agents influence their decisions, cooperation, and conflicts.
- **Cultural Transmission:** Cultural traits and practices are transmitted across generations, impacting the long-term evolution of agent societies.

### 5. Advanced World Simulation
The simulation environment supports different world types:
- **Procedural World:** A dynamically generated world with random climate, resources, and population distribution.
- **Scenario World:** Predefined scenarios such as Ice Age, Global Warming, and Resource-Rich or Resource-Poor environments.

### 6. Explainable AI (XAI)
- **Decision Trees:** Agents use decision trees trained on past decisions to provide explanations for their actions.
- **Natural Language Explanations:** Agents generate human-readable explanations based on their cognitive state, emotional influences, and personality traits.

### 7. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Advanced Techniques

- **Advanced Social Simulations:** The simulation incorporates complex social interactions, cultural evolution, and the impact of AGI on society.

### 8. Minor Features:
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: The RL agents use the PPO algorithm to optimize their policies in an environment with continuous state and action spaces.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Agents are designed to balance multiple conflicting objectives (e.g., economic growth vs. environmental sustainability) using the Pareto front approach. This allows agents to explore a trade-off space and make decisions that are not solely based on a single reward function.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Simulate complex interactions among multiple agents, including alliances, trade, warfare, and diplomacy.
- **Hierarchical Learning**: Agents utilize hierarchical reinforcement learning to manage complex, multi-step tasks by decomposing them into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This approach allows for more efficient learning and decision-making, particularly in environments with multiple layers of objectives.
- **Social and Cultural Evolution**: The agents' decision-making processes are influenced by social and cultural dynamics, which evolve over time. Agents can choose to adapt to these changes or actively influence them, leading to emergent behaviors such as cultural convergence or divergence.
- **Machine Learning Enhancements**: The project integrates advanced machine learning techniques, including neural architecture search and automated feature engineering, to optimize the performance of the RL agents. These enhancements allow for more sophisticated models that can better capture the complexities of the simulated environment.
- **Transfer Learning**: The RL framework incorporates transfer learning, enabling agents to apply knowledge gained from one scenario to new, unseen scenarios. This approach reduces the training time and improves the generalization of the agents across different environments.
- **Coordinated Multi-Agent Environment**: The simulation includes a coordinated multi-agent reinforcement learning environment, where multiple agents interact with each other. This setup allows for the simulation of complex, real-world scenarios involving competition, cooperation, and negotiation among agents.

### Technologies Used
